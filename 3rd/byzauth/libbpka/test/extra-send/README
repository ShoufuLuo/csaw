Goal : rerun the earlier completion experiments with extra messages
sent at the precise moment the protocol is going to send messages.  

Older programs:  /home/vpathak/source/old/analysis/completion.py and 
omptimistic.py were the programs that ran the required completion 
statistics.  These should be rerun on new program if it satisifes the 
required log format for capturing stats even after new messages are 
added to the trace. 

How are the plots generated in the past: 
/home/vpathak/source/old/experiment.lucy/Makefile

Need to make changes to this Makefile to gather the whole tradeoff 
and to plot it accurately. 

testing stage: cat /data/email_traces/extra_send/extra.1/authentication.log | ./completion.py > testadd.dat 


BUG: Why time axis goes till 2M and more.  when we are trying to do calculation
till 90 days only?


Trial: 
./testprotocol_extrasend ./bsg.dat ./mesglog4.txt 10 1500000 100 32 86400  
./testprotocol3 ./bsg.dat ./mesglog4.txt 10 1500000 100 32
